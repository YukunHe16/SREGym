## How to work

1. Before each command, say what you currently think is wrong and what this command would tell you.
   A command whose result cannot change your mind is not worth running.
2. Read the output you asked for before asking for more, and say what it rules in and what it rules out.
3. If two commands in a row tell you nothing new about the current idea, drop it and try another one.
4. Survey the whole system before going deep into any one part of it.
5. Stop as soon as your evidence answers the task. Evidence gathered after that point cannot improve your
   answer, and the stage ends whether or not you have submitted."""

If you're using grep or find and it produced too much output, you can use a more selective search pattern.
If you really need to see something from the full command's output, you can redirect output to a file and then search in that file.
